    	<h1>About</h1>
    	<p>
        	Fotocolor is a picture editing website that allows users to upload a picture and 
        	select from four different editing features. For tips on using the site, and some 
        	details on each feature, see <a href="about.html" style="background-color:#ffffff">Instructions</a>. 
    	</p>
    	<br>
    	<h3> GRAYSCALE </h3>
    	<p>
    	    Feature: Gives the image in gray-scale.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	    How it works: Gray is made up of equal parts R, G, and B. My program iterates through 
    	    each pixel and finds the average of the R, G, and B values, and saves new pixels with 
    	    that average value for R, G, and B.
    	</p>
    	
    	<br>
    	<h3> COLORSELECT </h3>
    	<p>
    	    Feature: The users selects four colors and a new image is produced in which each pixel 
    	    is changed to the closest of the four selected colors.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	    How it works: My program compares every pixel’s color to each of the four selected 
    	    colors using a 3-D distance formula where R, G, and B are the three dimensions. It 
    	    then identifies which of the user selected colors is closest to the original pixel 
    	    color, and converts the pixel to that color.
    	</p>
    	<br>
    	<h3> COLORPOP </h3>
        <p>
            Feature: The user selects four colors and a similarity requirement for their new image. 
            Only colors that are within the similarity limit to a user selected color appear in the 
            new image, while all colors that are not similar enough to any user-selected color are
            converted to grayscale.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            How it works:  My program compares each pixel’s color to each of the four selected colors using a 3-D 
            distance formula where R, G, and B are the three dimensions. If the original pixel is within the similarity 
            requirement limit to any selected color, the original color is carried over to the new image. 
            Otherwise, it is converted to gray-scale.
  	     </p> 
  	     <br>    
  	     <h3> K-MEANS COMPRESSION </h3>
        <p>
            Feature: The users selects a number of colors between 2 and 10 to which they 
            would like their image compressed. An image is then produced that reduces each 
            pixel to the closest cluster’s mean.
        </p>
  	    <p>
  	        How it works: The algorithm uses a cluster analysis technique where the pixels 
  	        are grouped into the user selected number of clusters. Each pixel is then compared 
  	        with the mean of each cluster, and then converted to the closest cluster mean. 
  	        See the algorithm I used <a href="https://github.com/harthur/clusterfck" style="background-color:#ffffff">here</a>.
